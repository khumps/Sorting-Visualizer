# Sorting-Visualizer
This is a visualizer aimed at allowing the user to see how each sorting algorithm works and how it performs in comparison to other algoritms.

This was written as a final project. I was responsible for implementing all things in the gui package, the utils package,as well as BitonicSort, ParallelBitonicSort, and SelectionSort. My teammates split up the rest. My work also incldes all hooks made in the sorters to visualize the algorithms.
